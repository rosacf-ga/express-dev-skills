# Express Dev Skills Lab

Modules follow best-practice routing and MVC:
- **routes/skills.js**
- **models/skill.js**
- **views/skills**
- **controllers/skills.js**

## Part 1
- Scaffold a new app named `express-dev-skills` using express generator.

- Create an array of "fake" data representing some developer skills.

- Implement **index** functionality for the `skills` resource

- Implement **show** functionality for the `skills` resource


## Part 2

1. Display an _Add Skill_ link on the **index** view that when clicked, displays a **new** view that displays a form for entering a new Dev Skill.

2. When a new Dev Skill is submitted, the skill is added to the "database" and redirects the user to the **index** view.

3. On the **show** view, display a _Delete Skill_ link that when clicked, deletes the skill from the "database" and redirects to the **index** view.

4. On the **show** view, display an _Edit Skill_ link that when clicked, displays an **edit** view that displays a form for editing that Dev Skill.

5. When the edit Dev Skill form is submitted, the skill should be updated in the "database" and redirect the user back to the **show** view.
